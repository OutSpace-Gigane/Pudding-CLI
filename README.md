Advanced Alt ver of [famote-fellow](https://github.com/OutSpace-Gigane/famote-fellow)

- Current version: (1.001)

## Getting Started

Installation should be from "Releases" Section or you can "git clone" the Repository too.  
after the Installation go to the directory that you installed the Engine.  
You Might need Open a Terminal, then type this command:

```
python puding.py
```

(You'll need to answer the questions from the executed script btw.)

## Configuration

It's planned to make a Configuration file to make the things easier but currently i'm done.  
So feel free to suggest, edit the code, or anything else!

## Notes

- It ONLY makes Standards of Python CLI-Tool Project
- You'll need to learn too much things so i just added a "Cheatsheet" (it will shown for Manual Configuration)
- Any Suggestions or Bugs: outspace_gigane (discord)

## Kind of Facts n' Spoilers i guess

- The Inspiration (Kinda) taken from [ReactJS](https://react.dev) project but it works for CLI.
- you can count this is an improved version of "famote-fellow".
- Might make Wiki about this (How is this idea?)

> [!WARNING]
> If you have any Folder / Directory called: "src", Delete it. Since the Script makes a Directory called "src".
