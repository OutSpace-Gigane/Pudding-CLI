You Might need Open a Terminal, then type this command:

(You'll need to answer the questions from the executed script btw.)

It's planned to make a Configuration file to make the things easier but currently i'm done.  
So feel free to suggest, edit the code, or anything else!

## Notes

- It ONLY makes Standards of Python CLI-Tool Project
- You'll need to learn too much things so i just added a "Cheatsheet" (it will shown for Manual Configuration)

## Kind of Facts n' Spoilers i guess

- The Inspiration (Kinda) taken from ReactJS project but it works for CLI.
